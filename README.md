## 🎯 Project Overview

Excited to share my latest project on **AI and gesture recognition**!

This is a real-time **hand gesture recognition application** built using **TensorFlow** and **React**, designed to demonstrate how AI can understand human gestures and enable futuristic human-computer interaction.

### 🔍 What It Does

- 📸 Uses your webcam to detect your hand
- 🧠 Identifies finger positions using deep learning
- 🤏 Recognizes gestures like "thumbs up", "victory", etc.
- ⏱️ Processes everything in real-time, right in the browser
